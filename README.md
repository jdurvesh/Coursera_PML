#Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit, it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. The aim of this project is to predict the manner in which participants perform a barbell lift. The data comes from http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har wherein 6 participants were asked to perform the same set of exercises correctly and incorrectly with accelerometers placed on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell.

#For the purpose of this project, the following steps would be followed:

#1.Import the Data 
#2.Removing Columns that are not relevant
#3.Using Random Forest 
#4.Predicting Test Set Output for 20 cases
